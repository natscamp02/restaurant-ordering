# Restaurant Ordering System

## Instructions

You are required to build an application using MySQL, Express and Node for a Restaurant Ordering System. The application should have the following features.

-   Allow for anonymous users to go on a page and select their menu choices and place an order for it.
-   Orders are not confirmed until a user with the correct password (the Admin) logs into the system and confirms that the order is paid for.
-   The admin should be able to view active orders as well as edit them.
-   The user should be able to enter their email address and a random number generated when they are ordering to access their orders.
-   Each order is unique and should be assigned an order number
-   Your database should be properly structured to allow for all these features to take place.

## Notes

-   **Ensure to design your database tables before starting the coding segment. Design your Database tables in MS Excel**
-   **Write a paragraph or more detailing how your application will work**
-   **We will discuss the various approaches in class on Tues, 10/5/2022**
